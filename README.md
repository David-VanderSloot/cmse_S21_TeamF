# cmse_S21_TeamF
Final Project spring 2021 CMSE 202


Notes for running the code:

Blocks should be run in the order that they are written
with the notebook where it is in the msl-images folder. 

Do not run the grid search chunk unless you think
your computer can handle it; it takes forever and 
will melt the cpu of any unworthy machines.


Contributions:

Aaron K: Performed the grid search for ideal parameters / Helped write project code 
David V: Helped write project code / Set up repository, jupyter notebook, and other communal resources
Lucy S: Wrote code and shared screen during collaborative work sessions / Edited the video of the final presentation
Mary A: Found Dataset / Made the final presentation slides / Helped write project code
Yuxuan Z: Helped write and troubleshoot project code

And a huge thanks to the CMSE202 teaching team for helping us through the sticky bits and the course coordinator
for writing the SVM code we used as a skeleton for much of the project.
